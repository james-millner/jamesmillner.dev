# Article Design: Senior Engineer to Engineering Manager

## Context
- James transitioned from Senior Software Engineer to Associate EM in 4 months (Jan-May 2025), then to full EM (Jan 2026), same company
- Key themes: ambiguity of management problems, subtle loneliness of role shift, varying coding balance, pride in shipping as a team leader
- Target audience: Senior engineers considering the move to management
- Anti-patterns to avoid: LinkedIn platitudes, humble-bragging, "10 things I learned" listicle format

## Approach
"The Honest Field Guide" — chronological walkthrough of the first year, structured around phases of the transition. Personal hook, real experience, practical takeaway. Matches existing blog voice.

## Structure

### Section 1: The Hook (~150 words)
A concrete moment that captures the before/after — first codeless day, or first meeting with no clear answer.

### Section 2: Why I Made the Move (~200 words)
Honest reason for the shift. New company, strong relationships formed fast, opportunity presented itself. Acknowledge the fear of giving up what you're good at.

### Section 3: The Early Days — Associate EM (~250 words)
4-month sprint from Senior to Associate EM. What changed, what stayed the same. Natural bits (relationships, unblocking) vs. alien bits (decision rooms, ambiguity).

### Section 4: The Hard Middle — The Bits Nobody Warns You About (~300 words)
Heart of the article. Two threads:
- The ambiguity: no clear right answers, just trade-offs
- The loneliness: subtle repositioning, knowing things you can't share

### Section 5: The Coding Question (~200 words)
Directly address the elephant. Still code, varies week to week. Still figuring it out. Identity still engineering, just different shape.

### Section 6: The Breakthrough — Shipping Something Big (~200 words)
Emotional payoff. Leading a team through complex delivery. Pride in team output, not personal code.

### Section 7: What I'd Tell a Senior Engineer Considering the Move (~200 words)
Grounded reflections: it's a career change not a promotion, you'll miss coding, ambiguity doesn't vanish, wins feel different but real. Forward-looking close.

## Fitness

I've been getting back into fitness and trying to push myself in a new domain. The weather's picked up, so I've been a bit more active on the bike! As the keen eyed may have noticed, I've updated this site with my strava URL for
any fellow strava-nuts out there, it's where I share most of my active life. Here's a ride I did this weekend just gone!

<div class='strava-embed-placeholder' data-embed-type='activity' data-embed-id='7295941858'></div><script src='https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js'></script>
</div>

_(I've also figured out how to embed strava activities for any future cycling posts :eyes:)_

I've also tried to re-pick up weight lifting lately. Two of my colleagues at work have recently reinforced that it should be formally know as the 'Congregation of the Iron Church', so as a result I'm starting to follow that name - I thought it was quite funny.
Although its currently more a pilgrimage to the iron church rather than a congregation.

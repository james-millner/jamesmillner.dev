I've recently started, or well, feels like recently, my journey into Engineering Leadership. I've wanted to write about this transition for a while now, but I've struggled to put something together that felt genuinely useful rather than just another "here's what I learned becoming a manager" post. So instead of trying to be clever about it, I'm just going to be honest about what it's actually been like.

## Why I Made the Move

I joined as a Senior Software Engineer in January 2025 at Lendable, an exciting FinTech start up based out of Shoreditch, London. A new company, a fresh start - I was excited to join as a Senior Engineer here as I'd come from a very Spring Framework heavy background, and Lendable hadn't gone for that approach. From the get-go, I focused on building strong relationships — understanding the people, the codebase, the problems. That part came naturally to me. I've always thought that good engineering is as much about communication as it is about what you can deliver in code.

About four months in, I was put forward for an Associate Engineering Manager role. I won't pretend I'd been plotting a management career for years — the opportunity presented itself because of a gap in the team, but also from the relationships I'd built and the trust that came with them.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't hesitate. There's a real fear in stepping away from the thing you've spent your career getting good at. Writing code, solving technical problems, shipping features. I felt like I'd just got comfortable with that level of seniority. Was I giving that up? And was it too soon?

I wasn't giving it up — but the role does change shape. And too soon? Maybe. But I'd rather take the chance and grow into it. If you wait until it feels safe, you'll be waiting a long time.

## Early On

While the transition from Senior to Associate EM happened faster than I expected. Some things felt immediately natural — unblocking people, having conversations about priorities, advocating for the team. If you've been a good senior engineer, you've probably been doing a version of these things already without the title.

But other things were properly alien. You start being in rooms where decisions happen differently. Less "what's the right technical solution?" and more "what's the right thing to do given these competing priorities, this deadline, and these stakeholders who all want different outcomes?" The inputs are messier. The feedback loops are longer. You don't get the satisfying green tick of a passing build at the end of the day.

I think the biggest adjustment in those early weeks and months, was realising that my output was no longer something I could point at. As an engineer, I could show you the PR, the feature, the fix. As a manager, my best work is often invisible — it's the meeting that prevented a problem, the conversation that kept someone from burning out, the decision that gave the team space to do their best work.

A big part of those early months was working alongside a supportive product counterpart. He backed me from early on, but not easily — he challenged me in the right ways. At times it was uncomfortable, but looking back, that discomfort was growth. Comfort rarely is.

## The Bits Nobody Warns You About

This is the part I think is worth being honest about, because it's the stuff I didn't see coming.

### The Ambiguity

As an engineer, you debug a failing test and eventually you find the answer. It's there, hiding in the code somewhere. Management problems aren't like that. Someone comes to you with a situation — maybe a team dynamic issue, maybe a delivery risk, maybe a decision about where to invest effort — and there's no definitively correct answer. There are just trade-offs with different consequences.

I knew this going in — you don't step into management expecting it to be like debugging. But knowing it intellectually and feeling it day-to-day are different things. It took me a while to stop reaching for a definitive answer and accept that sitting with ambiguity is part of the job, not a sign that you're doing it wrong. You gather context, you talk to people, you make a call, and then you live with it. Sometimes you get it right. Sometimes you learn. The discomfort doesn't fully go away — you just get better at navigating it.

### The Loneliness

This one surprised me the most, because it's not dramatic loneliness. It's subtle. You're still on the team, still in the stand-ups, still in the Slack channels. But there's a quiet repositioning that happens. You know things you can't always share. You make decisions that people might disagree with. You're no longer just another engineer who can have a good moan about a deadline or vent freely in a thread. Your communication has to tighten. What you say carries different weight now, and you start choosing your words more carefully — not because you're being political, but because you realise the impact is different.

Nobody really prepares you for that shift. It's not a bad thing, necessarily — it's just different. And it takes a while to find your footing in it. It's something even to date, I still have to think about daily.

That said, I don't want to be a stiff, corporate manager. I'm naturally informal, empathetic, and I want people to feel like they can be themselves around me. That hasn't changed — if anything, I think it matters more now. The goal isn't to become guarded, it's to be intentional. You can still certainly be approachable whilst being thoughtful about the weight your words carry. Getting that balance right is an ongoing thing, but I'd rather err on the side of being human than hide behind a job title.

## The Coding Question

I know this is the one that engineers considering the move agonise over, so I'll be direct: yes, I still write code. But it varies massively week to week. Some weeks I'm reviewing PRs, poking at a problem, or prototyping something. Other weeks I don't open an IDE at all.

I won't pretend I've nailed this balance — I'm still figuring it out, and I suspect most engineering managers are, regardless of what they say on LinkedIn. What I will say is that I still consider myself an engineer. The role looks different, the day-to-day looks different, but the way I think about problems hasn't fundamentally changed. I'm still drawn to systems thinking, to debugging processes the same way I'd debug code, to understanding how things connect.

## The Breakthrough

While its been a lot of growth, there was a moment where  it clicked - where I thought, "Ah, that's the rewarding side of management"

In the second half of the year, the team pivoted into a completely new domain. New problem space, new expectations, ambitious targets from the business. It was the kind of challenge that could easily have knocked confidence — but the team embraced it. My job wasn't to write the code — it was to clear the way, setup the right discussions, shield the team from noise, and make sure everyone had what they needed to do their best work in unfamiliar territory.

We delivered ahead of where anyone expected. The kind of outcome that, when the targets were first set, felt like a proper stretch. But beyond the delivery itself, the thing I'm most proud of is that the team came out of it healthier and more engaged than when we started. The ambiguity I mentioned earlier — the lack of a clear feedback loop? This was it finally clicking into place. The promotion to Engineering Manager acknowledged the work, but honestly, seeing the team deliver and thrive through that challenge meant more to me than the title change did.

## What I'd Tell a Senior Engineer Considering the Move

So, if you're still reading this - thank you. I'm just over a year into this, so take all of this with a pinch of salt. But here's what I'd want to hear if I were back in that Senior role, wondering:

- **It's not a promotion — it's a career change.** The skills overlap, but the job is fundamentally different. Treat it that way.
- **You'll miss coding some days.** And that's fine. It doesn't mean you made the wrong choice.
- **The ambiguity doesn't go away.** You just get more comfortable with it. If you need clear right answers to feel productive, this role will challenge you.
- **Your relationships are your superpower.** Everything I've achieved in this role traces back to the relationships I built early on. Invest in those.
- **The wins feel different.** They're less tangible, often delayed, and sometimes invisible. But when someone on your team grows, or a delivery lands well, or a process you started makes an impact — those wins are really rewarding.
- **You're still early.** I have to remind myself of this constantly. I don't have all the answers, and I shouldn't pretend to.

I'm still very much learning, and I suspect I'll look back on this post in a year and cringe at how little I knew. There's plenty I haven't figured out yet, and I'm sure a few lessons still waiting to catch me off guard. But that's kind of the point — you don't wait until you've figured it all out to share what you've learned so far.

If you're a senior engineer thinking about making the jump, I hope this gives you something more useful than a LinkedIn post. Feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to chat about it.

# Excuses, excuses, excuses

Unfortunately I totally missed May for publishing a post here, which I'm a little disappointed about which is why today I thought I'd write an entry. It was also partly inspired by seeing that we're already halfway through 2022, 
which seems mental! So in the spirit of checking in; Hello again!

I think without making too many excuses as the title suggests, it can be quite daunting to '_put pen to paper_'. I can put too much pressure on myself to come up with the perfectly crafted tech blog post,
when really consistency should be key even if it's not perfect - and shouldn't only be tech focused!. This is my first attempt at publishing articles in a domain I manage, but also I don't want to just post 
about my professional life, there's a lot more to daily life than coding (although it can be very rewarding). I mean I once had an 8 streak on [Worldle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and I haven't yet written a post about it!!!

However, there are a few topics I'm working on to do write-ups for in the very near future that I think will be interesting:

* Fitness
  * Road biking :biking_man: :mountain_biking_man:
  * Weight Lifting :weight_lifting_man:
* Re familiarising with GraphQL
  * During May my team at [Sky Betting & Gaming](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sky-betting-and-gaming/) did a Hackathon around GraphQL for some upcoming work in our team. It was fascinating, especially looking at how far framework support has come. Using tools provided by [Spring](https://spring.io/) & [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/).
  * I did lean towards [Micronauts](https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-graphql-gradle-kotlin.html) support, purely down to how fast we got something up and running. The documentation was clear and it was a great experience!
* Kotlin Coroutines
  * So far I've got by without a lot of Coroutine / Threading experience. I want to fix that, and publish a post about my L&D surrounding it. Rather than do the same thing over and over
* Kotlin Lambdas with Terraform

Note; Kotlin Lambda's swiftly changed, right after I posted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cracked some really neat stuff with <a href="https://twitter.com/micronautfw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@micronautfw</a> this evening with their cloud function support integrating with CDK! <br><br>Got a lovely Kotlin lambda, with infra written up in CDK via Kotlin too! Quite impressed with the outcome! Web post coming soon!</p>&mdash; James Millner (@_jamesmillner) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jamesmillner/status/1534301307766554624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I want to like [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), but [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) being so declarative just seems to get off the ground faster. Hence, the change of tact; however I might go back and revisit the Micronaut cloud functions.
After all as a starter it gets you up and running fast, but I think you'd need to invest a lot of time into CDK to get its value. Terraform works pretty much off the shelf, and the documentation for it is so good. More detail in another post!

As a final note I've also been tweaking and adjusting this site slightly! Check out below, I've even been able to implement a comment section using [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/)! I've been really impressed with Hugo & Congo, it does make 
it really easy to get setup and running with a site like this. If you're interested in setting your own site up like this, I've publicised the repo on my [github](https://github.com/james-millner/jamesmillner.dev). Anyway, for now I'll sign off this post
and post something again soon!

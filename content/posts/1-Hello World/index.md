# Hello :wave:#

Well this is new! Hello World! :earth_africa:

I've created this small site in an effort to organise my online space, share a bit more about the projects and work that I'm interested in, and to share some ramblings in a space I own. 
This site is set up with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and using the [Congo](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/), and boy is it neat!

Recently I've reflected a lot on the past couple of years and end up coming to the same conclusion:

"Where on earth did 2020 / 2021 go?"

Look I'll be the first to hold my hands up and say that during the Pandemic it was just a strange time, probably the biggest life event of the 27 years I've been here! Professionally thankfully I've been in a privileged business
that hasn't been affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic.

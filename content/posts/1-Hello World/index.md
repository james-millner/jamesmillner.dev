# Hello :wave:

Well this is new! Hello World! :earth_africa:

I've created this small site to organise my online space, share a bit more about the projects and work that 
I'm interested in, and to share some ramblings. 
This site is set up with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and using the [Congo](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/) theme, 
and boy is it neat! It's hosted and managed by [Netlify](https://netlify.com), making it easy to deploy updates and posts here! Woo!

This isn't _too_ unusual for me, I have had previous static sites before to try to host my own personal website. 
_Albeit I'm not really familiar with blogging, other than the occasional short form tweet._
But if I'm being honest, I've never been able to set something up that I've been 100% happy with. 
While this space is relatively new, it's definitely a start in the right direction, and so far Hugo / Congo has made it 
very simple to get something up and running that I quite like the look of. Especially with it looking like it's straight 
forward to structure pages and blog entries.

So, I wanted to keep this first post as a bit of an introduction-y sort of post and with that in mind I'd like to set 
up this space so that it has:

* A list of projects I've worked on / contributed too
* Blog style posts around tech and things I find interesting. As mentioned in [About]({{< ref "/about" >}} "About") maybe some cycling related waffle? :eyes:
* Up-to-date links to reach me, socials and such!

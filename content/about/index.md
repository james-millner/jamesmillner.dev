### Hi :wave:

My name is James Millner, and I'm currently located in [Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK](https://goo.gl/maps/b2JDpuxTTg5BFTe88) but have always lived in the Yorkshire area. 

I'm a Software Engineer primarily specialising in JVM based, event-driven applications. My experience is most recently routed in Kotlin, and is my hobby language of choice, but professionally 
I've also built and maintained Java based applications. I've got a focus on building lean, efficient, reliable and maintainable software systems and have just over 7 years of experience in industry.
My expertise lies in building applications that can handle asynchronous data flow and complex event-processing scenarios.

Beyond my professional life, I have a strong interest in cycling, after taking up the sport in **2018** it's thoroughly taken over my spare time. 
It's given me a huge appreciation for West Yorkshire, although it is very hilly! :mountain: Since 2018 I've clocked over 10,000KM in distance, and counting! Find me on Strava & Komoot!

### Fun Facts

- Unfortunately I'm not the legendary Liverpudlian footballer [James Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Milner) - although my mum will call me everytime I'm _"on the telly!"_
- I was a Scout for around 6 years and was lucky enough to attend the [22nd World Scout Jamboree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_World_Scout_Jamboree) :flag-se: :earth_africa:
  - As a result I own the same coat as the King of Sweden! 
  - _Although he might not have kept it for as long as I have_

### Engineering Specific Notes

I'm a huge advocate of Kotlin. Its expressive and concise nature takes writing JVM-based applications to a whole new level, which makes it a current hobby language of choice.

Spring Boot is another resource I often lean on. It simplifies the process of setting up stand-alone applications, eliminating a lot of the fuss associated with boilerplate code and infrastructure.

I've also spent a good amount of time with Kafka, an event-streaming platform that's ideal for handling high-volume, real-time data. It's an integral part of the event-driven systems I work with, and lots of my professional experience
has interacted with it.

In addition to application development, I've frequently been involved with Containerisation and DevOps, not just professionally, but also as a personal hobby. 
This interest aligns with my fascination for System-on-Chip (SoC) computing. The concept of integrating all the components of a computer onto a single chip captivates me, and I may have a decent collection of Raspberry Pi's, much to the joy of my partner. 

Given the impressive power that these compact machines now possess, they offer an excellent platform for skill development. Check out [my blog post about Pi's](https://jamesmillner.dev/blog/2022/03/14/raspberry-pi-day/), but I find Kubernetes fascinating and challenging, so I've been trying to upskill on my own 
playground.

So, these are the bits of tech that get me up and coding in the morning!

### Hi :wave:

My name is James Millner, and I'm currently living in [Huddersfield, United Kingdom](https://goo.gl/maps/8uTjwXLdxJSrSfUc6). 

I'm a motivated Software Developer and enjoy tinkering within the Software Engineering space as often as I can. I love cycling, after taking up the sport in **2018** it's thoroughly taken over my spare time. It's also given me a huge appreciation for West Yorkshire, although it's very hilly! :mountain:

### Fun Facts

- Unfortunately not the legendary Liverpudlian footballer [James Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Milner)
- I was a Scout for around 6 years and was lucky enough to attend the [22nd World Scout Jamboree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_World_Scout_Jamboree) :flag-se: :earth_africa:
  - As a result I own the same coat as the King of Sweden!

### Favorite Topics

Currently, I am very interested in **Kotlin**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka** and **Software Engineering** in general. 

I'm also very keen in the world of **DevOps** and **Containerization**. Fascinated by SoC computing and successfully operated a [K3s.io](k3s.io) raspberry pi cluster, with monitoring support via [Prometheus Operator - By Carlos Eduardo](https://github.com/carlosedp/cluster-monitoring) - Highly recommend checking out this repo if you intend to do the same.

None of the pieces published on my website, [jamesmillner.dev](https://jamesmillner.dev), are written by an AI tool. They
are written and curated by me.

That being said, Iâ€™ve used AI-assisted tools like the likes of GitHub Copilot, or Claude to help write code. I've also 
submitted text to be grammatically reviewed to help structure my thoughts. The suggestions from AI tools are purely suggestions and are never taken
verbatim in my work.

I'm committed to sharing authentic and interesting 
content here which will always be written, curated and reviewed by me, 
before being published here.

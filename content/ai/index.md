None of the pieces published on my website, [jamesmillner.dev](https://jamesmillner.dev), are written by an AI tool. They
are written and curated by me.

That being said, Iâ€™ve used AI-assisted tools like the likes of GitHub Copilot, or Claude to help write code. I've also 
submitted text to be grammatically reviewed, if anything just to help structure my thoughts. 

However, I'm committed to sharing authentic and interesting content here which will always be written curated and reviewed by me, 
before being published here.
